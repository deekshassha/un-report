## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##new start

```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

 This report was prepared to the attention of the UN. it analyses the relationship between a country'sGDP, its life expectancy, and co2 emissions. Our goal is to detrmine to what degree a country's economic strentgh or weakness is related to its public health staus and its impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and co2 emission increase with country's GDP.
