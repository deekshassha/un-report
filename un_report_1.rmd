Did you know that in R, the sum of 2 and 2 s "r four" this is an example of online code!
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

 This report was prepared to the attention of the UN. it analyses the relationship between a country'sGDP, its life expectancy, and co2 emissions. Our goal is to detrmine to what degree a country's economic strentgh or weakness is related to its public health staus and its impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and co2 emission increase with country's GDP.
 
```{r data}
gapminder_1997 <-read_csv(("data/gapminder_1997.csv"))
```
```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
```


```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
```


```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop/1000000))+
  geom_point()+ 
  labs (x ="GDP per Capita",
        y= "Life Expectancy",

The above plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy for total of"r n_countries" xxxx countries. For this set of coutries, economic wealth rangrd from a minimun of $xxxx to a mzximum of $xxx per capita.
```{r}
n_countries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()
```
```{r}
n_countries
minimum_gdp <-gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(min(gdpPercap))%>%
  round(digits = 1)
```

The above plot show the relationship netween Gddp per capiata and life expectancy for total fo r n countries . For thi set countries, economic wealth range from a minimus of "$ "r minimum_gdp" to a maxomum of $xxx per capita.


```{r}
n_countries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()
  
n_countries
  
maximum_gdp <-gapminder_1997 %>%
   summarize(max(gdpPercap)) %>%
   round(digits = 1)
   
maximum_gdp
   
```

The above plot shows the relation between gdo and expectancy.
